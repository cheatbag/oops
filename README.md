# oops
An fake network used to steal credentials.

Code is based on the original here: https://github.com/adamff1/ESP8266-Captive-Portal, with some tweaks to work with a display.

Once running, if you connect to the wifi from a pc (probably easier than your phone) you can browse to the web server on http://172.0.0.1/creds to view all the saved credentials or to http://172.0.0.1/ssid to change the ssid.
The credentials are written to the eeprom so will persist if the device loses power.
